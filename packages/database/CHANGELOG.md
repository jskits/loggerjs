# @loggerjs/database

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- `@loggerjs/core` is now a peer dependency of every other package, so an application installs exactly one copy of core. Install it alongside the packages you use, for example `npm install @loggerjs/core @loggerjs/node`; npm and pnpm add a missing peer automatically, Yarn does not. Every package requires `@loggerjs/core` `^1.0.0`.

- Require Node 22 or later: every package declares `engines.node: ">=22.0.0"`, and CI smoke-tests the packed packages on Node 22.0.0, the latest Node 22, and Node 24. Node 20 is no longer supported. Each Node line a major ships with stays supported for that whole major (see GOVERNANCE).

- LoggerJS 1.0. Every `@loggerjs/*` package moves to 1.0.0. Semantic versioning covers Stable exports: no removals, renames, or signature breaks within a major. Compatible exports and Experimental packages change only after a deprecation in an earlier minor. The support windows in GOVERNANCE and SECURITY now apply to every package: the previous minor gets security and data-loss fixes for six months after the next minor ships, the last 0.x minor gets security fixes for three months, and every Node line and browser baseline a major ships with stays supported for that whole major.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - @loggerjs/core@1.0.0

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Version alignment for package release `0.7.0`: every `@loggerjs/*` package moves to 0.7.0 together.

### Patch Changes

- Depend on `@loggerjs/core` with a caret range instead of an exact version. Upgrading `@loggerjs/core` on its own no longer forces the package manager to install a second copy of core underneath each LoggerJS package.

- Declare `engines.node: ">=20.19.0"`, the oldest Node release the packed packages are smoke-tested on in CI. Package managers can now warn when LoggerJS is installed on an older Node.

- Smaller application bundles. `createLogger()` with `consoleTransport()` drops from about 6.3 KB to 5.5 KB gzip after tree-shaking and minification, `browserHttpTransport()` from 8.5 KB to 7.8 KB, and `stdoutTransport()` from 6.9 KB to 6.2 KB.

  - New `safeJsonEncoder()` and `ndjsonEncoder()` in `@loggerjs/core/codec-json` are `safeJsonCodec()` and `ndjsonCodec()` without `decode()`. Transports that only send logs (browser and Node HTTP, WebSocket, worker, database, Node stdout and file) default to them, and `consoleTransport({ pretty: false })` encodes the same way, so apps that never decode leave out the payload validation. Output is unchanged.
  - Diagnostics instrumentation is removed entirely from bundles that never install a diagnostics sink, instead of leaving inert checks behind.

- Updated dependencies:
  - @loggerjs/core@0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- The database transports pick up the `@loggerjs/core` `batchTransport()` fix: when the database is failing, `close()` now stops retrying, still releases the adapter, and counts undelivered rows as `transport.dropped.closed`. No database source changes are included in this release.
- Updated dependencies:
  - @loggerjs/core@0.6.0

- Pointed `@loggerjs/database/transport`, `@loggerjs/database/sqlite`, and `@loggerjs/database/postgres` subpath exports at their dedicated bundles and declaration files.
